    "text": "Background on Cryptic Clues\nA traditional (UK-style) cryptic clue has:\n\nDefinition part: A direct definition of the solution word/phrase (similar to a standard crossword clue).\nWordplay part: A set of instructions for how to manipulate letters (anagrams, hidden words, homophones, reversals, etc.) to arrive at the same solution.\n\nFor example, a classic short cryptic clue is:\n\nDoctor in short supply (3)\n\n\nThe answer is DOC.\nDefinition: ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù is the direct definition for ‚Äúdoc‚Äù.\nWordplay: ‚Äúin short supply‚Äù is instructing us to take ‚Äúsupply‚Äù and shorten it (suppl) or notice that ‚Äúin short‚Äù might be indicating to chop off the last letters. The exact mechanism can vary depending on style, but it usually references a form of truncation or pun."

    "text": "Prompting an LLM to Create Cryptic Clues\nWe experimented with prompting a well-known LLM (we used GPT-4 in this case, but you can attempt similar prompts with other models). Our prompt was structured to explain the concept:\n\n‚ÄúPlease create a cryptic crossword clue for the word ACME. The clue must include a definition and a wordplay segment, in typical cryptic style.‚Äù\n\n\nGPT-4‚Äôs Response\nA top tip for Emily‚Äôs company (4)\nProposed Explanation: - Definition: ‚ÄúA top‚Äù is a concise definition for ACME (meaning the highest point). - Wordplay: ‚Äútip for Emily‚Äôs company‚Äù might be instructing us to take the first letter (tip) of ‚ÄúEmily‚Äù (E) plus a synonym for ‚Äúcompany‚Äù (e.g., C0 for ‚ÄòCo.‚Äô?), forming ‚ÄúE + C0‚Äù = ‚ÄúEC0‚Äù? That‚Äôs not exactly ACME."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\n\nLLMs can approximate cryptic crossword clue styles, especially if you provide instructions on structure and examples.\nAccuracy varies: Some attempts fail to connect the wordplay steps properly, indicating the complexity of cryptic logic.\nChain-of-Thought: When asked to explain the solution, LLMs often give plausible justifications, demonstrating how they might parse the puzzle.\n\nUltimately, cryptic crosswords demand exactness in logic, and LLMs are still prone to small mistakes in letter manipulation or wordplay instructions. However, with iterative prompts and examples, they can learn to craft passable (sometimes even excellent) cryptic clues‚Äîand solve them!"
