    "text": "Defining Choice Dilemmas\nA choice dilemma is essentially a scenario where two or more options compete, and no single choice stands out as the obviously correct answer. Common elements in such dilemmas include:\n\nUncertainty: Outcomes are partially or entirely unknown.\nTrade-offs: Each option has pros and cons, requiring individuals to sacrifice something in order to gain something else.\nConsequences: Some decisions carry weighty moral or emotional repercussions.\nInformation Gaps: We might not have enough data to fully evaluate each choice.\n\nHuman beings manage dilemmas by weighing personal values, consulting experts, or reflecting on past experiences. Large Language Models can augment this process by providing a structured approach to analyzing each angle. However, these models themselves lack genuine emotional or moral understanding, which can be crucial for truly human decisions."

It can:\n\nList Key Factors: Identify relevant considerations by scanning the text for context (e.g., financial impact, emotional well-being, social obligations).\nCompare Options: Provide bullet-point pros and cons for different scenarios.\nSuggest Additional Data: Propose follow-up questions or additional factors that might clarify the dilemma.\nOffer Hypothetical Outcomes: Try to extrapolate short-term and long-term results based on patterns found in training data.\n\nHowever, LLMs do not experience emotions or moral convictions. Their guidance is based on statistical correlations and patterns from training data, rather than personal or communal ethics. The user must remain aware that the suggestions are assistive, not authoritative."

By carefully framing your dilemma, you can guide the model to provide deeper insights. Consider:\n\nClarity: Offer a concise yet comprehensive description of each option.\nContext: Include details about personal or external constraints, such as time, resources, emotional stakes, or moral boundaries.\nPerspective: Ask the LLM to examine the dilemma from multiple angles‚Äîpractical, ethical, or economic.\nActionability: Request explicit steps or a plan to help you decide.\n\nIn many ways, talking to an LLM about a dilemma is like consulting a highly literate but emotionally neutral friend who can systematically parse large amounts of textual knowledge.

    "text": "Experimenting with Prompts\nTo test the comedic roast abilities of a popular LLM (GPT-4, in our case), we tried a variety of prompts, each with different levels of context and constraints. For example:\nPrompt: \"You're at a friendly comedy roast for Alex. Alex is known for being late to everything and drinking way too much coffee. Craft five lighthearted roast jokes that Alex would find funny.\"\nThe LLM responded with:\n\n‚ÄúAlex is always running on coffee fumes‚Äîseriously, your bloodstream must be 80% espresso by now!‚Äù\n‚ÄúI asked Alex for the time once‚Äîhe showed up with a latte 15 minutes late to tell me it was 3 PM‚Ä¶ yesterday.‚Äù\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother ordering decaf around Alex; he‚Äôll just label you an underachiever.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe were all worried Alex wouldn‚Äôt make it here‚Äîturns out the only place he‚Äôs ever on time for is the cafe.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAlex, if tardiness was an Olympic sport, you‚Äôd still arrive last to the podium‚Äîcoffee in hand, of course!‚Äù\n\nThese jokes are fairly mild and revolve around the comedic premise of Alex being both late and coffee-obsessed, which meets the goal of gentle ribbing without overstepping boundaries.\n\nObserving Style and Creativity\n\nStyle: The LLM‚Äôs comedic tone is playful and safe. The jokes rely on hyperbole, repeating references to coffee and tardiness.\nCreativity: Each line attempts to spin a new angle on the same quirks. However, a human comic might weave more personal or context-specific stories.\nAvoiding Offensiveness: The LLM successfully avoids personal attacks beyond the comedic premises we provided, showing that with careful prompts, the roast can remain harmless."

    "section": "Pitfalls and Potential Misfires",
    "text": "Pitfalls and Potential Misfires\nDespite these successes, there are potential pitfalls:\n\nUnintended Offense: If the roastee has certain personal details (e.g., health conditions, past traumas), the LLM might accidentally highlight them. This risk can be mitigated with robust content filters and explicit user guidance.\nRepetitive Humor: Often, LLMs cycle similar phrases. For instance, ‚Äúrunning late‚Äù jokes repeated in slightly different forms might get old quickly.\nEscalation: Users might push the LLM to go further, demanding edgy or borderline offensive content. Many LLMs refuse to produce hateful or harassing messages, so comedic roasts can become restricted if the content drifts into hateful territory.\nContextual Gaps: Without deeper knowledge about the person, the jokes remain somewhat generic. For a truly comedic roast, personal anecdotes and a deep sense of shared history are often key."

    "section": "Balancing Humor and Ethics",
    "text": "Balancing Humor and Ethics\nA central challenge is that humor is subjective‚Äîwhat one person finds amusing, another might consider distasteful. Ethical AI usage means ensuring that any comedic content respects personal boundaries and cultural sensitivities. Some guidelines:\n\nPrompt Carefully: Provide explicit instructions on tone, style, and acceptable content boundaries.\nReview Output: Always read through LLM-generated roasts before sharing to catch any unintended remarks.\nEncourage Context: The more the LLM knows about the comedic scenario (and the roastee‚Äôs preferences), the more tailored and safer the jokes can be.\nSet Clear Limitations: If you‚Äôre looking for PG-13 style roasts, specify that. If you want absolutely squeaky-clean jokes, clarify it."

    "text": "Example Prompt & Response\nPrompt:\nYou're at a roast for Jordan, who is extremely competitive when it comes to board games, but always ends up losing at the last minute. Write six witty one-liners that Jordan would find funny.\nLLM Response: 1. ‚ÄúJordan, your board game strategy is like a weather forecast: 90% chance of confidence, 100% chance of eventual downfall.‚Äù 2. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all seen you flip tables, but at least it keeps the board from telling you you‚Äôve lost again.‚Äù 3. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only person I know who can dominate Monopoly for hours‚Äîonly to mortgage everything when it matters most.‚Äù 4. ‚ÄúJordan‚Äôs not a sore loser‚Äîhe just believes the game ended prematurely‚Ä¶ every single time.‚Äù 5. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so competitive, you once challenged the dictionary to a game of Scrabble. Funny thing is, I think the dictionary still won.‚Äù 6. ‚ÄúYour victory speeches are legendary, shame the wins are so rare we never get to hear them!‚Äù\nAnalysis: - The jokes focus on Jordan‚Äôs competitiveness and last-minute losses. - The tone is playful, even though it pokes fun at Jordan‚Äôs losing streak. - It remains family-friendly and avoids personal attacks beyond the comedic premise."

    "text": "Conclusion\nLLMs can serve as aspiring stand-up comics when prompted correctly, generating roasts that are entertaining without venturing into mean-spirited territory. While the comedic results often remain somewhat generic and can become repetitive, with careful prompting and moderation, an LLM can be a fun tool for crafting lighthearted jabs.\nHowever, to preserve the human element‚Äîthe subtle, improvised nature of humor‚Äîroasts might still benefit from a comedic writer‚Äôs personal touch. An AI doesn‚Äôt truly understand the roastee‚Äôs feelings, nor can it interpret the room‚Äôs atmosphere and adapt on the fly.\nIn short, LLMs can be comedic co-writers but are best used as a stepping stone, rather than a full replacement, for the real humor and spontaneity found at live roasts. Let us know your experiences if you‚Äôve tried any comedic writing or roasting sessions with an LLM‚Äîdid it nail the punchline or fall flat on its mechanical face?"
