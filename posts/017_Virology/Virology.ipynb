    "In a landmark benchmark, advanced AI models such as OpenAI’s o3 and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved 43.8% accuracy in troubleshooting complex virology lab protocols—nearly double the 22.1% average accuracy of PhD‑level virologists—revealing that public frontier models now surpass most human experts in practical virology tasks . This finding, first reported by Time, was corroborated by in‑depth analysis across AI Frontiers and the Center for AI Safety’s Virology Capabilities Test (VCT), which comprises 322 “Google‑proof” questions requiring tacit, experience‑based knowledge  . While these capabilities promise accelerated disease research and diagnostics, they also raise urgent biosecurity concerns: the same AI prowess could enable untrained actors to design harmful pathogens if misused . Concurrent developments—such as Nature’s AIRVIC system for automated cytopathic effect detection and Harvard’s EVEscape variant predictor—demonstrate AI’s growing role in virology, underscoring the need for robust safeguards and governance frameworks to balance innovation with safety  ."

    "Expertise in virology traditionally requires years of specialized training, including hands‑on mentorship in biosafety level 3 (BSL‑3) laboratories . Yet a recent study led by the Center for AI Safety, MIT Media Lab, UFABC, and SecureBio positioned leading AI models against PhD‑level virologists in a blind evaluation of troubleshooting wet‑lab protocols, revealing a paradigm shift in what machines can achieve in life sciences ."

    "\n",
    "The VCT is a carefully designed benchmark of 322 multimodal questions covering key aspects of practical virology, including reagent preparation, assay troubleshooting, and biosafety considerations . Questions were validated by PhD virologists and crafted to be “Google‑proof,” requiring tacit procedural knowledge not readily found in literature or online resources . In this setting, OpenAI’s o3 achieved 43.8% accuracy, significantly outperforming the human expert average of 22.1%, while even excelling past 94% of virologists on specialty subsets ."

    "\n",
    "Advanced LLMs like o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro leverage vast textual and procedural data, enabling them to diagnose protocol deviations—such as incorrect buffer pH or incubation times—with greater consistency than experts relying on memory and intuition . AI Frontiers commentary highlights that these models can aggregate patterns across thousands of protocols instantly, whereas human troubleshooting depends on a finite personal experience . Such performance underscores AI’s capacity to encode and retrieve complex procedural knowledge at scale."

    "\n",
    "The democratization of expert‑level virology knowledge through publicly available AI models lowers barriers for legitimate research, potentially accelerating vaccine development and outbreak response . However, the dual‑use nature of this capability means similar AI guidance could aid malicious actors in designing or refining pathogens without requisite safety training . Policymakers and AI developers must collaborate on gating mechanisms, vetting users, and embedding biohazard safeguards in LLM APIs to mitigate these risks ."

    "Key proposals include restricting dual‑use benchmarks in publicly accessible AI, implementing know‑your‑customer protocols for advanced virology capabilities, and mandating pre‑release evaluation of AI models for biohazard potential . Industry initiatives, such as SecureBio’s collaboration with research labs, advocate for continuous monitoring of model outputs and integrating red‑team exercises focused on virology scenarios ."
