    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2025, OpenAI launched GPT-4o with native image generation built directly into the transformer, marking a departure from the diffusion-based DALL·E pipelines . This new capability is powered by an autoregressive, pixel-by-pixel generation process rather than the traditional iterative denoising used in prior models . Under the hood, GPT-4o learns the joint distribution of text and pixels, enabling seamless cross-modal understanding and generation ."

    "## Architecture: An Omnimodal Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-4o utilizes a single, unified transformer to model both language and vision, training on p(text, pixels) instead of chaining separate text encoders and image decoders . The model factorizes the probability of an image as a sequence of tokens—pixels or pixel blocks—using the chain rule P(x) = ∏ₙP(xₙ|x<ₙ) . This autoregressive framework leverages causal attention masks to ensure each image token attends only to previously generated tokens, mirroring text generation pipelines ."

    "## From Diffusion to Autoregression\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior OpenAI image models like DALL·E 2 and DALL·E 3 used diffusion: starting from pure noise and iteratively denoising toward a target image under text guidance . While effective, diffusion struggles with fine-grained control over object relationships and text fidelity. GPT-4o’s shift to an autoregressive approach—generating images left-to-right, top-to-bottom—delivers much stronger binding between objects and correct spatial relationships ."

    "## Enhanced Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object Binding:** GPT-4o can manage accurate placement and relationships for 15–20 distinct objects in a scene, compared to 5–8 typically handled by diffusion models .\n",
    "- **Text Rendering:** The autoregressive decoder produces clear, legible text within images, avoiding the garbled lettering common in diffusion outputs .\n",
    "- **Contextual Coherence:** By jointly modeling text and pixels, GPT-4o leverages its linguistic knowledge to generate contextually appropriate visuals without elaborate prompt engineering ."

    "OpenAI enhanced training data quality by relabeling millions of images using a custom CLIP-based captioning model that generated both concise and detailed synthetic captions, improving prompt adherence dramatically . GPT-4o extends this process by training on these richer annotations, grounding its joint representations in more accurate, expressive text-pixel pairs ."

Users can request adjustments—\"make the background darker,\" \"add a label here,\" or \"change the font style\"—and the model preserves style, layout, and semantics across turns . This iterative design loop transforms image generation into a practical tool for rapid prototyping."

    "GPT-4o’s autoregressive multimodal framework points toward a future where text, image, audio, and video are generated within a unified model, simplifying pipelines and reducing latency . Challenges remain in scaling to higher resolutions and longer sequences, driving research into efficient sparse-attention variants for vision tasks . Advances in captioning—such as character-level encoding—could further enhance spatial reasoning and textual precision, unlocking new creative possibilities."
