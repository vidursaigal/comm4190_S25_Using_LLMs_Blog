    "This blogs goes over my predictions for AI over the next decade. Nothing is certain or currently factual. \n",
    "Over the next decade, AI will transition into an \"Era of Experience,\" where agents generate their own training data from real-world interactions rather than relying solely on human-curated datasets . By 2027, traditional scaling laws will show diminishing returns, driving a pivot toward architectural innovation over brute-force compute growth. Economically, AI adoption will create 69 million new jobs in emerging roles while automating significant portions of routine work , and could contribute up to 7 percent of global GDP by 2033 . Societally, we will grapple with cognitive offloading risks as AI tools erode critical thinking skills , and synthetic media might comprise half of online content by 2029 . Environmentally, AI’s electricity demand could reach 1 500 TWh by 2030, rivaling national grids . Governance frameworks—led by the OECD and G20—will mandate energy reporting and AI risk assessments by 2027 , and by 2032, AI literacy will be a baseline leadership requirement in enterprises . Finally, narrow AGI may emerge around 2029 with broader human-level AGI by 2035, according to expert surveys ."
