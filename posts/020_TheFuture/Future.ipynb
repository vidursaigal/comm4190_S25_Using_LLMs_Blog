                "Over the next decade, AI will transition into an \"Era of Experience,\" where agents generate their own training data from real-world interactions rather than relying solely on human-curated datasets . By 2027, traditional scaling laws will show diminishing returns, driving a pivot toward architectural innovation over brute-force compute growth. Economically, AI adoption will create 69\u00a0million new jobs in emerging roles while automating significant portions of routine work , and could contribute up to 7\u00a0percent of global GDP by 2033 . Societally, we will grapple with cognitive offloading risks as AI tools erode critical thinking skills , and synthetic media might comprise half of online content by 2029 . Environmentally, AI\u2019s electricity demand could reach 1\u00a0500\u00a0TWh by 2030, rivaling national grids . Governance frameworks\u2014led by the OECD and G20\u2014will mandate energy reporting and AI risk assessments by 2027 , and by 2032, AI literacy will be a baseline leadership requirement in enterprises . Finally, narrow AGI may emerge around 2029 with broader human-level AGI by 2035, according to expert surveys ."
